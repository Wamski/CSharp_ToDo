# CSharp_ToDo (WIP)

This project was constructed as an introduction to the Avalonia UI framework.
The ToDo list allows the user to create multiple projects with the ability to add
 tasks to each different project. Users can add a task by clicking the `Add ToDo`
button. Users can remove a task by `right clicking` on the task that the user would
 like to remove.

## Coming in the near future:
- The ability to remove different projects by right-clicking them, like the todo
task items.
